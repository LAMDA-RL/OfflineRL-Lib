> ðŸš§ This repo is not ready for release, benchmarking is ongoing. ðŸš§

OfflineRL-Lib provides unofficial and benchmarked PyTorch implementations for selected OfflineRL algorithms, including: 
- [Extreme Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02328)

Currently OfflineRL-Lib is heavily based off [UtilsRL](https://github.com/typoverflow/UtilsRL), and we will release a standalone version once it is ready.
